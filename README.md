extracted code: data


## Architecture search
```python train_search_ntu.py```    

## Architecture evaluation
```python train_ntu.py```  

## Confusion matrix 
```python draw_confusion_matrix.py```  

## Visualization
Package graphviz is required to visualize the learned cells  
```python visualize.py DARTS```    
where DARTS can be replaced by any customized architectures in genotypes.py
